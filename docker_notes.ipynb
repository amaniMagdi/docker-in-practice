    "  WORKDIR /app\n",

    "## Docker Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Build Image**: Create an image from the Dockerfile. It is better to name the image using `-t \"imagename\"`. The `.` is used to build from the Dockerfile in the relative path.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  docker build -t express-node-app .\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **List Images**: To list all Docker images, use the following command:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  docker image ls\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Run Container**: Use the following command to run the container from the image. It is good practice to give the container a name.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  docker run --name express-node-app-container -d express-node-app\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  > `-d`: Run the container in detached mode (so the terminal is not taken over by the container).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Show Running Containers**: List all running containers with the following command:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  docker ps\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stop Container**: Stop the running container using this command:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  docker stop express-node-app-container\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Remove Container**: Remove the container forcefully using the following command:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  docker rm express-node-app-container -f\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Port Forwarding**: To forward the host port 4000 to the container port 4000, use this command:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  docker run --name express-node-app-container -d -p 4000:4000 express-node-app\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Access Container Terminal**: To access the container's terminal, run:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  docker exec -it express-node-app-container bash\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  > `-it`: Interactive terminal.  \n",
    "  > `express-node-app-container`: Name of the container.  \n",

    "  \n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  docker logs express-node-app-container\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Docker Hub (https://hub.docker.com) contains all the images you need, and it is open-source, meaning you can also publish your own images, similar to GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A Dockerfile describes how the application will run inside the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can create multiple containers from a single image.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Docker images consist of layers (e.g., Layer 1 is `node:14`, Layer 2 could be app files, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each container can hold a service, and the same app can run on multiple containers, with each service on its own container.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Node.js application note**: Nodemon is used in `devDependencies` to make the dev server listen for changes and reload automatically during development.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Docker Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is possible to create non-root users in your Dockerfile to avoid running everything as root.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A `.dockerignore` file specifies which files will be ignored during the image build and container runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Command Sequence Optimization**:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```Dockerfile\n",
    "  COPY package.json .\n",
    "  RUN npm install\n",
    "  COPY . .\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  By separating `package.json` from copying all files, Docker can utilize caching mechanisms. This ensures that `npm install` is triggered only when there are changes in `package.json`, thus preventing unnecessary reinstallation of packages when other files change.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Environment variables are stored in a `.env` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Optimization Tip**: Limiting which files are copied is an optimization step to reduce build time and storage space.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Docker Hot Reload\n",
    "\n",
    "- Any changes in the local directory will not be reflected in the container unless the image is rebuilt and the container is rerun, which is impractical.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We used volumes with binding (local_dire:container_dir) to apply hot reload\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hot reload** allows syncing between local and container files (mirroring the local directory with the container directory).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hot reload can be achieved using the `-v` flag (from volumes) and the absolute path of the local directory and container directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  docker run --name express-node-app-container -v F:/DevOps/docker/my-express-app:/app -d -p 4000:4000 express-node-app\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Disadvantages of hot reload**: Any files created or removed inside the container will automatically be reflected in the local directory.\n"

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Docker Volumes\n",
    "**Used Types:**\n",
    "-  **Bind mount:** like hot reload.\n",
    "- **Anonymous:** used when storing data on hard drive is needed (like if we use our container as database service).  **Bind mount:** \n",
    "> **two way binding:** any change in local dir will be reflected on container dir and vice versa, that is not best practice.\n",
    " ```bash\n",
    "  docker run --name express-node-app-container -v F:/DevOps/docker/my-express-app:/app -d -p 4000:4000 express-node-app\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  > **one way binding:** any change in local dir will be reflected on container dir only and not vice versa.\n",
    " ```bash\n",
    "  docker run --name express-node-app-container -v F:/DevOps/docker/my-express-app:/app:ro -d -p 4000:4000 express-node-app\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "> Regarding **one way binding** if we deleted important directory like `node_modules` from local will be deleted from container so if we need to maintain these files and dirs we can use anonymous mount `use another -v before these files and dirs in run container command`. **But there is an easy way is to make binding to the files and dirs you want container to listen to their changes.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The container is a process working on machine on specific port. Working on memory but if we want to store data on hard drive so will use concept of volumes and that is the most common use case for volumes. "
